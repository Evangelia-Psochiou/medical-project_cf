The project involves a management system for therapists and patients, providing remote speech therapy and special education services. The patient registers and then logs into the platform to create a ticket. During the ticket creation process, the patient specifies the desired service and describes the symptoms, and the ticket is activated.

Subsequently, the therapist logs into the platform and views the active tickets. When the patient begins sessions, the therapist fills in the diagnosis and deactivates the tickets. If there is a new therapist, they must register and then log in.
